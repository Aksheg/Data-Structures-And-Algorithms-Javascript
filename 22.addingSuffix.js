/*
Adding Ordinal Indicator Suffixes
Task
Finish the function numberToOrdinal, which should take a number and return it as a string with the correct ordinal indicator suffix (in English). For example, 1 turns into "1st".

For the purposes of this challenge, you may assume that the function will always be passed a non-negative integer. If the function is given 0 as an argument, it should return the string "0" without a suffix.

To help you get started, here is an excerpt from Wikipedia's page on Ordinal Indicators:

st is used with numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 1st, pronounced first)
nd is used with numbers ending in 2 (e.g. 92nd, pronounced ninety-second)
rd is used with numbers ending in 3 (e.g. 33rd, pronounced thirty-third)
As an exception to the above rules, all the "teen" numbers ending with 11, 12 or 13 use -th (e.g. 11th, pronounced eleventh, 112th, pronounced one hundred [and] twelfth)
th is used for all other numbers (e.g. 9th, pronounced ninth).
Specification
numberToOrdinal(number)
take a number and return it as a string with the correct English ordinal indicator suffix

Parameters
number: Number - The number to be converted to a string ordinal

Return Value
String - Returns a string ordinal based on the number.

Constraints
0 â‰¤ number â‰¤ 10000

Examples
number	Return Value
1	     "1st"
2	     "2nd"
3	     "3rd"
4	     "4th"
21	     "21st"

//SOLUTION-BRUTE FORCE - basic approach
function numberToOrdinal(number) {
  if (number === 0) {
    return "0";
  }

  if ((number >= 10 && number <= 20) || (number >= 110 && number <= 120)) {
    return `${number}th`;
  }

  let conversion = String(number).split("");
  let lastNumber = Number(conversion[conversion.length - 1]);

  if(lastNumber === 1){
    return `${number}st`
  } else if(lastNumber === 2){
    return `${number}nd`
  } else if(lastNumber === 3){
    return `${number}rd`
  } else{
    return `${number}th`
  }
}

console.log(numberToOrdinal(0));
console.log(numberToOrdinal(1));
